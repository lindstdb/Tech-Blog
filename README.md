# Tech-Blog

## Description

A CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

- The motivation to create this application, was to generate the opportunity to share knowledge about all things tech.

- I built this project to create a space for people to converse about different technologies and stay ahead in their field.

- This application solves the problem of having no one to tell when you make a major discovery in the tech space.

- Through the process of building this app, I learned everything I thought I knew about mysql, and heroku deployment.
